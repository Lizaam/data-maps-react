# React Maps

This is simple map project in which data gets pulled to display certain points on the map based on time and date selected, these points are random coordinates that were generated internally on the backend.

React Maps was built using React Hooks, along with some dev dependancies to keep it as light as possible.

To begin, use `npm install` to install all dev dependancies.

To clone respository, run following command 

`git clone https://github.com/Lizaam/data-maps-react.git <br /> cd react-maps-app
`

To run development environment, run following command

`npm start`

To build for production, run following command

`npm build`
